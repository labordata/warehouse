      <p>This is a database of representation certification election and unfair labor practice cases since 2010. It is updated nightly.</p>

      <h2>Data Limitations</h2>

      <ul>
          <li>The data starts around 2010. See <a href="./cats">cats</a> for data from the previous system</li>
          <li>The update process starts by downloading a CSV of all the cases within a specified time period from the nlrb.gov website. However, repeatingly requesting the same information from nlrb.gov results in spreadsheets with slightly different contents. We might be a bit out of date if the last CSV we downloaded missed a recent case.</li>

    description: This file was built from an old database of union elections maintained by the AFL-CIO in Washington, DC. It contains election results for all petitions filed with the NLRB between 1965 and 1998 that went to elections. That is to say, it does NOT contain data on organizing drives where petitions were filed but later withdrawn or dismissed.
