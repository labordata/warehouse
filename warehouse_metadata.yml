      <p>This is a database of representation certification election and unfair labor practice cases since 2010. It is updated nightly.</p>

      <h2>Data Limitations</h2>

      <ul>
          <li>The data starts around 2010. See <a href="./old_nlrb">old_nlrb</a> for data from the previous system</li>
          <li>The update process starts by downloading a CSV of all the cases within a specified time period from the nlrb.gov website. However, repeatingly requesting the same information from nlrb.gov results in spreadsheets with slightly different contents. We might be a bit out of date if the last CSV we downloaded missed a recent case.</li>
      </ul>
